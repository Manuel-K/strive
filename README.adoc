Strive -- A Strife: Veteran Edition port
========================================

This is a fork of _Strife: Veteran Edition_, the only change at the
present is a major cleanup of the source tree and a build system
rewritten with http://scons.org/[SCons].  To compile it, make sure you
have SDL 1.2, SDL-mixer 1.2, SDL-net 1.2, FFmpeg, libpng, and OpenGL
headers installed.

It's only really been tested, and likely only works on, Linux.  No
installation target is available, but feel free to copy the resulting
+strive+ binary as you please.  Hypothetically SCons is supposed to be
able to work with MSVC on Windows too, but I personally do not care to
try such things for myself.  Also the SCons files are my very first
ones ever and likely need to be scrapped for some better ones.

Have fun!
